# Ride Completion, Billing, and Wallet Credit Flow

When the driver completes a ride and taps the “RIDE COMPLETE” button:

A perfect and professional billing alert should be displayed.

The user can make the payment using any available payment method, such as:

Cash

Online payment

Driver account transfer

Any other supported payment option

After the user completes the payment:

The ride amount should be credited directly to the driver’s wallet, regardless of the payment method used.

The amount shown in the billing alert must be the exact ride amount.

When the user taps OK or Close on the billing alert, the same amount should be stored in the driver’s wallet automatically.

The credited wallet balance can later be:

Used for future in-app purposes (for example, online shopping or other supported features)

Overall, the billing flow should be smooth, accurate, and professional, ensuring that the displayed amount and the wallet-stored amount always match.
